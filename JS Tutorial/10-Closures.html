       * What Are Closures

           a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

           Closures are used to persists data without having to define variables in the global scope,

           
        */
        // an example on persisting data without using closures (using global variables)
        let lightSwitch = "OFF";

        const toggleLight = function () {
            if (lightSwitch === "OFF") {
                lightSwitch = "ON";
                return "the light is " + lightSwitch;
            } else {
                lightSwitch = "OFF";
                return "the light is " + lightSwitch;
            }
        };
        // above we have a function that toggles a global variable between ON and OFF, what if we had multiple functions that are
        // controlling other light switches they all would be using the same variable and that would result in mess so it solve that we could use closures


        //1-example..............       
        const toggle = function () {
            let lightSwitch = "OFF";

            // this anonymous function is a closure function that has access to it is own closure variable
            return function () {
                if (lightSwitch === "OFF") {
                    lightSwitch = "ON";
                    return "the light is " + lightSwitch;
                } else {
                    lightSwitch = "OFF";
                    return "the light is " + lightSwitch;
                }
            };
        };

        // the variable will be equal to the return value of toggle so it will be equal to the closure function
        const toggleLight1 = toggle();
        // we need a second invocation to be able to invoke the closure function
        toggleLight1(); // => 'the light is ON'
        toggleLight1(); // => 'the light is OFF'
        toggleLight1(); // => 'the light is ON'
        // we can create another variable to control another light
        const toggleLight2 = toggle();
        toggleLight2(); // => 'the light is ON'
        toggleLight2(); // => 'the light is OFF'
        toggleLight1(); // => 'the light is OFF'
        // now we have a persisted data without using a global variable


        //2-example .............
        const employee = function (name, position, salary) {
            const empName = name;
            let currentPosition = position;
            let empSalary = salary;

            return {
                promote: function (newPosition, newSalary) {
                    currentPosition = newPosition;
                    empSalary = newSalary;
                    return empName + " has been promoted";
                },
                getInformation: function () {
                    return "name: " + empName + "\n position: " + currentPosition + "\n salary: " + empSalary;
                },
            };
        };

        const employee1 = employee("John", "Junior Developer", 1000);
        // as you can see below the employee information are hidden
        employee1; // => {promote: ƒ, getInformation: ƒ}
        // access the the method using dot notation and invoke the method
        employee1.getInformation(); // => name: John
        // => position: Junior Developer
        // => salary: 1000
        employee1.promote("Senior Developer", 2500); // John has been promoted
        employee1.getInformation(); // => name: John
        // => position: Senior Developer
        // => salary: 2500
