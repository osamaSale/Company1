        What Is OOP
          Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of "objects", 
          which can contain data, often known as attributes or properties, and code, 
          in the form of procedures often known as methods.

        // 1- exmple
        const employee = function (name, position, salary) {
            const emp = {};

            // add all variables along side methods as key value pairs in the emp object

            emp.position = position;
            emp.salary = salary;

            // instantiated unlike how it happens when using closure methods.
            emp.promote = promote;
            emp.getInformation = getInformation;

            // the keyword `this` refers to the object that is calling this method usually the object on the left of
            // the dot, more explanation in the next example
            this.position = newPosition;
            this.salary = newSalary;

        const emp1 = employee("John", "Junior developer", 1000);
        // since the keyword `this` is inside getInformation and when invoked the object of the left of the dot is emp1 then it will refer
        // to emp1 and be able to get it's attributes
        emp1.getInformation(); // => name: John
        // => position: Junior developer
        // => salary: 1000
